Save the best articles of 2012 to your Instapaper account
---------------------------------------------------------

This script lets you save more than 100 great long-form articles from 2012 to your [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) account, for reading offline. Great if you are going on holiday, or have a long plane ride. 

The full list of articles was curated by Conor Friedersdorf of the Atlantic, and [can be found on Byliner.com](http://byliner.com/spotlights/102-spectacular-nonfiction-articles-2012). 

If you like these articles, you should subscribe to the [Best of Journalism newsletter](http://thebestofjournalism.blogspot.co.uk/) - $1.99/month for a weekly email with links to the best long-form articles around the web. 

Please note: I have no affiliation with Conor Friedersdorf, the Best of Journalism, or Byliner. 

### How to run the script 

Check out or download this repo to a local directory.
 
    $ git clone https://github.com/annapowellsmith/instaconor.git

Then `cd` to that directory and run the script: 

    $ cd instaconor
    $ python load2012.py

The script will ask for your Instapaper email or username, and your password if you have one. It will then automatically add all the articles to your account.
